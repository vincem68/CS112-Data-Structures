This project was about parsing, adding, and multiplying numbers that were too large to store in an integer variable in Java. The application would first take a command to either parse, add or multiply numbers. Once a command was selected, the application would ask for a String value that would represent a number. The parse command would return the same inputted String value devoid of any extra whitespace or invalid characters, and the add and multiply commands would take two String values for numbers, convert them into linked lists, calculate the result and return it as a String. Negative numbers are allowed.
