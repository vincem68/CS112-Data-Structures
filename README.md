This repository contains all the projects I did for my Data Structures class. The purpose of the class and the projects was to learn how to use different kinds of data structures 
for different kinds of tasks that would best suit them. In project 1, for example, the application would use linked lists to represent numbers too large to store in regular
integer variables in Java for math calculations. The data structures used in these projects include linked lists, stacks, graphs and trees. Other structures taught in class were 
queues, hash tables, heaps, and also sorting algorithms.
