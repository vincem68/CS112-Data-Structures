This project was a program that would take a mathematical expression and compute it in the proper way using order of operations. The expression could have any 
number of parenthesis anywhere, and do addition, subraction, multiplication and division. This program also could use variables of different names, either regular
variables "such as 'a'", or array variables "such as A[1]". The program could take a text file that would say what variables had what value.
